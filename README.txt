Some possible ideas:
- GUI improvement in color, widgets, everything
- GUI improvement in choice of voice
    - Choose language from world map
    - Choose neural etc. from picker wheel
    - Enable save of some presets of settings
    - Show last and/or most used settings as possible presets
- Saving last settings
- Program counts signs that were synthesized
- Saves your files in download folder
    - Does not overwrite your voice files
    - Replay doesn't start automatically
    - Lists your voice files with text in GUI like a version
- Use of SSML with SSML tags
    - SSML tags can be added in an easy way when text is marked
        - programs shows if it violates something
    - SSML tags are not visible as SSML tags (instead it is visualized with
        color, format etc.)
- If everything is implemented, create YouTube-account, rewrite everything and
    let it looks like it was written in some days
- After that implement some unknown mechanism to earn money with creating and
    implementing further ideas
